# Weather-application

- Made a Command Line Weather viewing application using Node.js and various npm modules like yargs, chalk, request. It helped me to learn how to do APIs calls and use the json data.
- Here I have used 2 APIs, the Mapbox API and the Dark sky API.

### Getting Started

- Clone or Download in the local repository.
- install all the npm packages which this application is dependent on.

### How to Run

```bash
node app.js weather --location="name of the place whose weather you want to view"
```
